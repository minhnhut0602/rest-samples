Basic Arquillian Testing

%{toc|fromDepth=2}

* What is Arquillian?

    Arquillian provides you with 'in container testing', that is: it will provide all the things you need to package
    a custom mini version of your application, deploy it to an application server, and then run the tests.

* Why you should use it

** Why to test within the container

    When testing within the container this gives you all the the nice things like a transaction manager, full access
    to persistence, and fully working CDI contexts.

** Why not to test within a container

    When you think you will need a container this might indicate that you haven't written testable code in the first
    place. Please verify if you can rework your tests to work without a container to test their functionality. This
    should be true for most if not all of the business functionality you have in your project.

    The tests within the container will run a lot slower than outside of the container as there is additional overhead.

    A container will start within seconds, but a simple JUnit test can be run within a few milliseconds.

* How to use it

** Update your pom.xml file

    Please some dependencies to your project's <<<pom.xml>>>:

%{snippet|id=arquillianbasic1|url=file:pom.xml}

%{snippet|id=arquillianbasic2|url=file:pom.xml}

** Setup your environment

    You need to have JBoss installed somewhere on the path. The location is given as an envrionment setting like this:

+----+
JBOSS_HOME=D:\jee\jboss-as-7.1.1.Final
+----+

** Write your test cases

    <<<SimpleArquillianTest.java>>> gives a minimal overview of a test class.

%{snippet|id=arquillianbasic3|url=file:src/test/java/de/ahus1/rest/endpoint/test/SimpleArquillianTest.java}

    When adding asserts of any kind, please use the ones that have a String as the first parameter. This allows you to provide a meaningful
    message of what is the expected outcome of the test. This is then also shown when this test fails, and it is an invaluable
    piece of information for the developer to come to fix the JUnit test.

    Please note: JUnit tests need (inline) documentation like every other piece of code.

** Running your tests

    You run them like any other JUnit test. Please ensure that JBoss is currently not running on your machine.
