Using Hamcrest Matchers in your tests

%{toc|fromDepth=2}

* What are Hamcrest Matchers and why you should use them

  The asserts of JUnit become hard to read, especially the error messages are not very meaningful when you do complex comparisons.

  Hamcrest Matchers provide a new (and to me better) way of writing asserts. Especially if you want to be typesafe in your
  comparisons and want to handle collections.

* How to use it

  Add another two dependency to your project

%{snippet|id=junithamcrest1|url=file:pom.xml}

  Then take the old code:

%{snippet|id=junitbasic2|url=file:src/test/java/de/ahus1/model/manual/test/SegmentTest.java}

  and convert it to Hamcrest matchers

%{snippet|id=junithamcrest2|url=file:src/test/java/de/ahus1/model/manual/test/SegmentHamcrestTest.java}

* Where to learn more about it

  Please read the short tutorial to learn more about it: {{http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/Tutorial}}

* Tips and Tricks

  In order to get code-assist in Eclipse, add <<<org.hamcrest.Matchers>>> and <<<org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert>>> to your
  favorites like described in {{{http://www.vogella.com/articles/JUnit/article.html#usingjunit_staticimports}Lars's article}}.
