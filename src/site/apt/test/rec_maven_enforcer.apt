%{toc|fromDepth=2}

* What is Maven Enforcer?

    The Maven Enforcer Plugin gives you the chance by adding simple Java classes to verify your build.
    If the verification fails, you build fails as well.

* Why you should use it

** If you need access to you maven project settings

    A lot of tests can be implemented as JUnit tests as well. But implementing it as a Enforcer rules will provide
    you with access to all the information of the Maven project.

* How to use it

** Update your pom.xml file

    Please some dependencies to your project's <<<pom.xml>>>. This will include a custom enforcer to prevent cycles
    between classes in your project.
